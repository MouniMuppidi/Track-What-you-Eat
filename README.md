# Track-What-you-Eat
As a group we analyzed a food dataset and predicted high calorie, high protein and other different questions using statistics and visualizations. The task involves analyzing a dataset of 299 foods with information on their nutritional values, such as calories, fats, proteins, saturated fats, carbohydrates, and fibers. The foods are categorized into various groups, such as desserts, vegetables, and fruits. The analysis includes exploratory data visualization, predicting the top 10 foods with the largest combination of calories and fats, analyzing drinks, alcohol, beverages, and desserts, finding the top 10 protein-rich foods, and analyzing meat, poultry, and seafood for high-fat content. The goal is to gain insights into food categories and nutrition for predicting the healthiest food options.
